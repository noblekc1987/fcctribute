                <p><strong>About the Founder</strong></p>
                <p>
                    Quincy Larson was a school director for six years before he started to learn to code so that he could create tools for making schools more efficient. His own journey into learning to code was long and winding and he recognized the need for a single-track curriculum for newbie developers. Upon analyzing data on coding boot camps in the US and realizing how inaccessible coding education was to the masses, he set out to create a fully-online inclusive free platform for peer-driven learning of coding - the result of which is freeCodeCamp.</br>

                    He lives in Texas with his family and spends his time working on freeCodeCamp, writing and interviewing authors for the freeCodeCamp publication, co-ordinating open source projects such as Chapter (a free MeetUp alternative), advocating for a free and open internet and playing with his two young kids.

                <p><strong>About FreeCodeCamp</strong></p>
                <p>freeCodeCamp (also referred to as “Free Code Camp”) is a non-profit organization that consists of an interactive learning web platform, an online community forum, chat rooms, online publications and local organizations that intend to make learning web development accessible to anyone. Beginning with tutorials that introduce students to HTML, CSS and JavaScript, students progress to project assignments that they complete either alone or in pairs. Upon completion of all project tasks, students are partnered with other nonprofits to build web applications, giving the students practical development experience.</p>
